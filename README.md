# drop-quotes-puzzle

A drop quote puzzle run in the command prompt. This project gave me an opportunity to begin working with Java unit testing as well as introducing me to using Git. The project is fully functional with a hint system and multiple quotes to choose from. If I were to come back to this, I would add more quotes and make the playing board more interactive.

## How to Play
The game chooses a quote at random and the goal is to fill in the correct letters in the grid using the columns of letters stacked above.
